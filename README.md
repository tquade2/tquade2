### Howdy, I'm Taylor! ðŸ‘‹

After seven years in the Air Force, I earned a degree in GIS and city planning. It was during this academic journey that I delved into the realms of programming and urban informatics. The potential of leveraging digital systems to foster better transportation systems truly captivated me.

Armed with a blend of technical discipline, adaptability, and an analytical mindset, I am keen on harnessing software to address intricate city planning conundrums. My goal is to leave a lasting footprint in the urban spaces, making them more functional, accessible, and vibrant.
