### Howdy, I'm Taylor! ðŸ‘‹

Having devoted seven years of my life to the Air Force as a Munitions Systems Supervisor, I've always been ingrained with a sense of technical proficiency. However, an inherent curiosity and a relentless drive to constantly learn and challenge myself led me down a different path.

After seven years in the Air Force as a Munitions Systems Supervisor, I earned a degree in GIS and city planning. It was during this academic journey that I delved into the realms of programming and urban informatics. The potential of leveraging digital systems to foster better social outcomes truly captivated me.

Looking ahead, my aspirations are clear. Armed with a blend of discipline, an analytical mindset, and adaptability, I am keen on harnessing software to address intricate city planning conundrums. My goal is to leave a lasting footprint in the urban spaces, making them more functional, accessible, and vibrant.
