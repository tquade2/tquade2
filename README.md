### Hi, I'm Taylor!

After seven years in the Air Force, I earned a degree in GIS and city planning. During this academic journey, I delved into the realms of programming. This led me to join the Tech Elevator coding bootcamp. I aim to combine my military discipline, GIS knowledge, and programming skills to become a proficient software developer.
