### Hi, I'm Taylor!

After serving in the Air Force for seven years, I transitioned to pursue a degree in GIS and city planning, where I uncovered my passion for programming. This newfound interest led me to enroll in the Tech Elevator coding bootcamp. I'm excited to merge my military discipline, GIS expertise, and programming skills to excel as a software engineer.
